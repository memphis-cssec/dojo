# Welcome to Tiger Dojo!

Tiger Dojo is a dojo based on the <a href="https://www.pwn.college"> pwn college </a> infrastructure, designed by spencer tartera, spiros thanasoulas and Prof. Christos
Papadopoulos.

pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. Feel free to check it out for more cybersecurity fun! We can't thank the pwn.college team enough for this amazing platform!

Each assignment is organized into modules (dojos) where you will be able to access an in browser virtual environment to complete tasks. 
Inside the virtual environment, you can investigate the challenge binaries, usually living under /challenge. 
By completing challenges you can get flags to submit and thus get points.

We hope that you can use this dojo to learn more about digital forensics, 
and also to point you back to <a href="https://www.pwn.college"> pwn college </a> for learning more about the art of hacking programs.
